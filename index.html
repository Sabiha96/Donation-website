            <p>Thalassemia is a very common blood disorder in Bangladesh. It is caused by a genetic mutation that
                results in defective hemoglobin production. The disease manifests as severe anemia in early childhood,
                usually between 1-3 years of age. The typical symptoms are pallor, jaundice, frequent infections, poor
                appetite, irritability, poor growth, and abdominal distension.
