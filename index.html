            <p>Thalassemia is a very common blood disorder in Bangladesh. It is caused by a genetic mutation that
                results in defective hemoglobin production. The disease manifests as severe anemia in early
                childhood,
                usually between 1-3 years of age. The typical symptoms are pallor, jaundice, frequent infections,
                poor
                appetite, irritability, poor growth, and abdominal distension.</p>

                    Thalassemia patients need a life-long monthly blood transfusions and expensive medications to
                    survive. Most of the patients at our hospital are poor. </p>

                    And cannot afford sufficient treatment and thereby, becomes chronically ill. We collect zakat to
                    support
                    these patients with life-saving treatments.
